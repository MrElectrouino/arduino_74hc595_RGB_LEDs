# arduino_74hc595_RGB_LEDs


In this video, I will show you how to make rgb led effects projects with the help of Arduino UNO and shift registers 74hc595. Arduino Uno only has 13 digital pins so not possible to control 12 rgb leds. That's why I came with the shift register 74hc595. We need only 3 Arduino digital pins to control as many LEDs as you want. All you need a shift register ic.

THere is 12 RGB led with 20 effects
